# to-do-list-ko
A Simple, (Mostly) Responsive To-Do list app in Backbone.js and JQuery.

## Introduction
This is a simple To-Do list app I made to implement the MV* framework using Knockout.js. You can add items to your to-do list by filling out the input field and clicking on *Add to List*. You can also clear your list and remove individual list items.
